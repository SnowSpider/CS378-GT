Wonjun Lee
I created the 3D environment and game objects, applied texture to them, and wrote the material files for the new textures. I implemented the physics simulation as well. I also grabbed some free sound sources from the internet and modified them with Audacity to fit our needs before pushing it into Howard's methods. Finally I merged the works of the three teammates. 

Strengths: Hardworking; familiar with various tools; C++ geek
Weaknesses: Poor documentation and spaghetti code.

Daniel Moreno
He integrated CEGUI with OGRE and successfully implemented the scoreboard and the sound toggle. 

Strengths: Fast learning; a lot of gaming experience; knows what defines a good game, both commercially and critically. 
Weaknesses: easily distracted by his grand projects in Minecraft while working with the teammates.

Howard Fu
He wrote the SoundManager, which uses the SDL to provide the sound effects. The SoundManager was simple and reliable. 

Strengths: Gets the job done. 
Weaknesses: He needs to communicate more with the rest of us.
