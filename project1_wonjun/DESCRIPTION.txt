Fuctionalities:

- A box, textured with Rockwall pattern. The box is made out of 6 individual planes, which have their normal vectors facing inside so that they are transparent when viwed from outside.
- A white ambient light.
- A red point light.
- A ball, textured with Chrome pattern. It starts moving in a random direction, at a constant velocity, and bounces off the walls. The position is updated every fram to compare against the surface of the box.


Remarks:

- No unsolved problems.

- No extra software other than what's already been installed in the CS lab machine.

- The source code is based on the TutorialFramework from the Ogre3D wiki.

- 

- The frame rendering loop does not create any new object, let alone delete them, so you don't have to worry about stack overflow. 

- Texture and control for extra credit!!! (OK these are very primitive.)
