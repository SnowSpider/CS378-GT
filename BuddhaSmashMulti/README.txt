To build & run:

./buildit
./OgreApp

The networking has been fully implemented. 
In the main menu, press "Singleplayer game" button to play a single player game.
In the main menu, press "Multiplayer game" button to play a multiplayer player game.
The host must first press "Create Room" to create the game. They will not be able to serve untill a client has joined.
The client must press "Join" and enter in the IP of the Host, for example "128.83.120.69".
There appears to be a bit of visual lag between the two computers, but this does not effect the calculations.
